! WARNING: This is where things fall apart...
!   Jacobson (2001) states that some Yupik question words
!   inflect like nouns and take derivational suffixes.
!   The examples given only ever show these question words
!   affixing to the derivational suffix ~:(ng)u 'to be N'
!   however, and some strange root form of the question word
!   is used, to never appear again in other derivations.
!   e.g. The root of 'kinkungutsi' is 'kinku-' but we don't 
!        know anything else about the productivity of 'kinku-'.
!
!   Since this is the case, we're going to disregard these
!   one-time-use roots and encode these "question-word + ~:(ng)u"
!   derivations as exceptions.
!
!   Cheers to future fieldwork that might be able to figure this out.
