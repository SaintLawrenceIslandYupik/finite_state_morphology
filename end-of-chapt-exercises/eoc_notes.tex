\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item 4: \textit{\textbf{nuyaqatakestaaghhaaguq}} will resolve with Ch.18, when we account for postbases that can attach to inflected nouns.

\item 4: \textcolor{magenta}{nanevgaq}

\item 4: \textcolor{magenta}{nengyugka} 

\item 4: One of the consonants \textit{wh}/\textit{ll} in {\textit{\textbf{aawhllaget}}} should undouble.

\item 5: \textcolor{magenta}{aaken} 

\item 5: The \textit{gh} should have dropped in \textit{\textbf{naayghaghmeng}}, since it is not marked as strong.

\item 6: The \textit{gh} should have dropped in \textit{\textbf{sivuqaghmeng}}, since it is not marked as strong.

\item 7: \textit{\textbf{apeghtughistegpekliilleqii}} will resolve with Ch.18, when we account for postbases that can attach to inflected nouns.

\item 7: \textcolor{magenta}{nanevgam}

\item 8: The \textit{gh} should have dropped in \textit{\textbf{sivuqaghmun}}, since it is not marked as strong.

\item 8: The citation form is given as \textit{alquutagh} for the base in \textit{\textbf{alquughtaten}}. 

\item 8: \textit{\textbf{sangavek}} will resolve with the implementation of the consequential mood. 

\item 8: \textcolor{magenta}{nagatestaak}

\item 8: \textcolor{magenta}{quyillgaat}

\item 8: If the analysis for \textit{\textbf{aghveliighsiin}} is \textit{aghvegh-–liigh[TO-COOK-OR-PREPARE-N][N→V][V][Intrg][2Sg]}, then the given surface form has an extra \textit{i}.

\item 8: \textit{\textbf{angyangllaghyugsiin}} has an extra \textit{i}?

\item 8: \textit{\textbf{qikmighllalguziin}} has an extra \textit{i}?
%
Unless I'm missing something.

\item 8: If the analysis of \textit{\textbf{neqeka}} is \textit{neqe[N][Abs][1SgPoss][SgPosd]}, how does \textit{e}-dropping work here?

\item 8: There may be a possible typo here in \textit{\textbf{laalighsigu}}, since the citation form is \textit{laalighte}.
%
Final-\textit{e} shouldn't drop from this long base, yes?

\item 9: If the analysis of \textit{\textbf{ivaghta}} is \textit{ivagh[V][Intrg][3Sg]}, this shouldn't be possible, since \textit{ivagh} is transitive only, and the interrogative form is for intransitives.

\item 9: \textcolor{magenta}{ighneghaan}

\item 9: \textit{neghegkaawaa} and \textit{aghviqaawa} should resolve when the postbase \textit{@*$\sim_\text{sf}$--(g*)kaq} is implemented correctly.

\item 9: \textcolor{magenta}{kitumun}

\item 9: If the analysis of \textit{\textbf{naallghutestesiki}} is \textit{naallghute(te)ste[V][Intrg][2Sg][3Pl]}, why does the \textit{z} become an \textit{s}?

\item 9: \textcolor{magenta}{qergesengi}

\item 10: \textcolor{magenta}{laalighfikiikut}

\item 10: \textcolor{magenta}{kaaskaagut}

\item 10: The analysis of \textit{\textbf{qayunghitesqaa}} should be \textit{qayu--nghite$\sim$sf:isqe}.
%
This contains the postbase that we have implemented differently from Jacobson (p.64).

\item 11: If the analysis of \textit{\textbf{sangighqiisqumakangi}} is \textit{sangighqugh-~sf:isqe[TO-ASK-OR-TELL-ONE-TO-V][Cmpd\_Vbl]-@₃~:(u/i)ma[to-have-V-ed-or-to-have-been-V-ed][V][Ptcp][3Sg][3Pl]}, is there no velar/uvular rounding on the \textit{q}?

\item 11: \textcolor{magenta}{siqinghem}

\item 11: \textcolor{magenta}{ghevesimakanga}

\item 11: \textit{\textbf{sukalnguut}} looks like \textit{sukate*-@*ngugh*[the-one-that-V-ed][the-one-that-is-V][V→N]} with a verb ending, but the \textit{@*ngugh*} postbase should result in a noun.

\item 11: \textcolor{magenta}{nanuum}

\item 11: \textit{\textbf{qelpeghsimaak}} is probably the same issue as \textit{ghevesimakanga}.
%
Where is the \textit{s} coming from??

\item 11: \textcolor{magenta}{akitutaqukung}

\item 11: \textcolor{magenta}{atiimaaq}

\item 12: \textcolor{magenta}{ingaghngaghpek}

\item 12: \textcolor{magenta}{aghnalqwaaghaq} from noun base \textit{aghnalqwaagh}

\item 12: \textcolor{magenta}{salngagegnituq} is from noun base \textit{salngag}, potentially followed by a possessed absolutive form in which case, this item should resolve when Chapter 18 is implemented and there is a continuation class following the possessed absolutives.

\item 12: \textit{\textbf{whaantuq}} should resolve when Chapter 16 is implemented, and those demonstratives and their postbases are coded into the \textit{lexc} file.

\item 12: \textit{\textbf{neghegkayuguuq}} may be a similar issue to \textit{salngagegnituq}.

\item 13: \textit{\textbf{negheghnaaghpek}} appears to be missing a \textit{g} if its analysis is \textit{neghe[V][Conc][2Sg]}.

\item 13: In \textit{\textbf{ungipaateghngaaghpenga}}, \textit{-penga} is a transitive indicative ending, not a transitive concessive ending.j

\item 13: \textit{\textbf{quginakanka}} should come from the emotional root \textit{quginag}, but it does not look like it is followed by a postbase associated with the emotional roots.

\item 13: \textbf{(!!!Priority)} We have a parsing issue with \textit{\textbf{uyviinghet}}.

\item 14: \textit{\textbf{elqwaaghniighhaakut}} is \textit{elqwaaghniigh[to.hunt.for.N][to.search.for.N][to.ask.for.N][to.work.with.N][N→V]}, but what is the ending?

\item 14: If \textit{\textbf{qefliqutamken}} is \textit{qefliqe-~:(u)te[to.V.for.or.with][to.cause.to.V.as.one.is.V-ing][to.V.toward.each.other][V→V][V][Ind][1Sg][2Sg]}, \textit{qefliqe} is an intransitive verb.

\item 14: If \textit{\textbf{qilunghata}} is \textit{qilug[V][Ctmp][3Pl]}, an \textit{e} is missing.

\item 14: \textit{\textbf{ighaluqaghmengllu}} is \textit{ighaluqagh[N][Abl\_Mod][Unpd][Sg]-llu[Encl]}, but the weak \textit{gh} did not drop.

\item 14: \textcolor{magenta}{akuzingigalkuvek}

\item 14: \textit{\textbf{qavaneghpeni}} contains the alternative form for the intransitive second singular subject contemporative, or is it the only recognized form?
