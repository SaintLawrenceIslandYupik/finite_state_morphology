\section{Logical Errors}

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item There seem to be recurring issues when postbases are affixed to the underlying form of \textbf{kiikw} (See \textit{kiiw+te}).

\item \textbf{aate@$\sim$:(u)sigh-} generates \textit{aaasigh-}

\item \textbf{qeneghte-@‚ÇÅ~:(u)tke-} generates \textit{qenghutke-}, which is correct, but will not parse in the other direction (from surface to underlying).
%
The dictionary also permits \textit{qeneghtutke-} where semi-final \textit{e} is not dropped.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Postbases}

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item \textbf{+tmiighte} \textit{to go in N direction} . Used with demonstrative adverb bases and positionals, but the latter appear to be fully lexicalized  

\item \textbf{+tmun} \textit{N-ward, toward N} .  Used with demonstrative adverb bases and positionals, but the latter appear to be fully lexicalized  

\item \textbf{@$\sim$:(u)ta} \textit{condition with respect to V-ing} . Non-productive unless it carries the meaning listed here

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item \textbf{+tala} \textit{the extent of V-ness} . Used with descriptive bases

\item \textbf{+tutka} \textit{to be V or have N to an indicated degree} . Used with descriptive bases

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item Which nouns/nominal postbases that end in \textit{-a} in the citation form end in \textit{-e} in the underlying form? 

\item Which nouns/nominal postbases ends in strong \textit{-gh} / weak \textit{-gh}?

\subsection{Questions Concerning Postbases}

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item The dictionary documents several postbases as being allomorphs of one another, e.g. \textit{mlaagh}, \textit{mraagh}, \textit{vlaagh}, etc.
%
Are there no conditions on when each form surfaces?

\section{Notes on Design Choices}

\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand\labelitemi{$\cdot$}

\item Postbases marked \textit{marginally-productive} were implemented, while those that were marked \textit{probably non-productive} were implemented if the examples given did not seem to be lexicalized.
%
Those that were marked \textit{non-producitve} were removed.

\item Some postbase-attachment examples introduced bases that were not included in the original lexicon of bases (See \textit{+tala}).
